PlayStreamAPI should be used on GameServers to subscribe to PlayStream events. NEVER use it on client build because this api uses Developer Secret Key to connect to PlayStream server. It is up to the server how it wants to handle the event messages. The PlayStream event data models are provided and they should be used for both clients and servers. 
Start receiving PlayStream events by subscribing to OnPlayStreamEvents, and it will automatically start the connection. 
An example is provided in https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFabGameServer.
